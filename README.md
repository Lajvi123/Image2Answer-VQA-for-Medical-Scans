# Image2Answer-VQA-for-Medical-Scans

## Introduction
This project aims to develop a multimodal Visual Question Answering (VQA) model for a unique dataset of breast ultrasound and brain MRI scans. The dataset was created by combining pre-existing labeled medical scan datasets with generated question-answer pairs across four categories: scan type, tumor existence, tumor type, and tumor location.
